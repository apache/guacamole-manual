About this README
=================

This README is intended to document the build process of the Apache Guacamole
manual for technical users who wish to contribute or who simply wish to build
the manual themselves.

The [latest version of the manual](http://guacamole.apache.org/doc/gug/) is
provided on the [Guacamole web site](http://guacamole.apache.org/), and
snapshot copies of each release are included in the [release
archives](http://guacamole.apache.org/releases/).


What is guacamole-manual?
=========================

The guacamole-manual package is the base documentation for the entire Guacamole
stack. It is largely written in [the "MyST" flavor of Markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
with portions of the documentation written in reStructuredText where necessary
(the Guacamole protocol reference).

MyST was chosen as the primary format because:

 * As a variant of Markdown, it will be widely approachable and familiar.
 * It is supported by Sphinx.
 * It provides additional syntax for the features of reStructuredText that are
   absent from standard Markdown (like admonitions).
 * It provides the features of Markdown that are absent from reStructuredText
   (like nested inline formatting, including formatting within links or links
   within formatted text).

reStructuredText is occasionally necessary because:

 * [MyST does not support docstring field lists](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/issues/163#issuecomment-640008632),
   a feature of reStructuredText required for documenting APIs. We use this
   feature for documenting the Guacamole protocol.
 * The MyST solution to supporting docstrings is [embedding blocks of
   reStructuredText](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/howto.html#use-sphinx-ext-autodoc-in-markdown-files).

The build process involves filtering any `.j2` files through Jinja2, generating
configuration documentation from `.properties.in` snippets, and finally running
the Guacamole manual source through the tooling provided by the Sphinx project
(`sphinx-build`).


Build requirements
==================

Building the Guacamole manual from source requires:

 * **Python 3.8 or later**
 * An implementation of "make", such as [GNU
   Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
 * [Sphinx](https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/)
 * [sphinx-rtd-theme](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-rtd-theme/) (the
   ReadTheDocs theme for Sphinx),
 * [sphinx-inline-tabs](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-inline-tabs/)
 * [myst-parser](https://pypi.org/project/myst-parser/)
 * [jinjanator](https://pypi.org/project/jinjanator/) or
   [j2cli](https://pypi.org/project/j2cli/)

The required Python packages can be installed using the "pip" package manager:

```console
$ pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme sphinx-inline-tabs myst-parser jinjanator
```

On some systems, the Python 3 version of "pip" may instead be named "pip3", to
maintain compatability with users and scripts that expect Python 2:

```console
$ pip3 install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme sphinx-inline-tabs myst-parser jinjanator
```

Building the manual
===================

If all build requirements have beein installed, the manual can be build by
simply running "make":

```console
$ make
```

The manual will then be built using Sphinx. Once complete, the entire HTML
version of the manual will be available within the `build/html/` directory in
the root directory of the source tree.

Building and viewing the manual using Docker
============================================

The guacamole-manual package includes a `Dockerfile` that can be used to build
an Apache httpd Docker image that contains the Guacamole user manual.

By building and running the resulting container, a developer can work on the 
user manual without the need to install Sphinx on their workstation. The
resulting container can also be used to serve the  manual to Guacamole users on
a network.

**Docker CE version 1.6 or later is required to build the image.**

Build the Guacamole manual container image by running the following command in
the directory that contains this Dockerfile:

```console
$ docker image build -t guacamole/manual .
```

Run the resulting container using the following command:

```console
$ docker container run -p 8080:80 guacamole/manual
```

You'll see some startup messages from Apache httpd on your terminal when you 
start up the container. Once the container is running you can then view the 
HTML version of the manual by accessing http://localhost:8080 using your web 
browser.

If another process on the host is already using port 8080, you will need to 
change the corresponding argument in the command used to start the container.

As a developer working on the documentation, it will be necessary to stop the
container and run the build again each time you wish to see changes you've 
made to the documentation source.
