Using SAML for single sign-on
=============================

SAML is a widely implemented and used Single Sign On (SSO) provider that allows
applications and services to authenticate in a standard way, and brokers those
authentication requests to one or more back-end authentication providers. The
SAML authentication extension allows Guacamole to redirect to a SAML Identity
Provider (IdP) for authentication and user services. This module does not
provide any capability for storing or retrieving connections, and must be
layered with other authentication extensions that provide connection
management.

Installing/Enabling the SAML authentication extension
-----------------------------------------------------

{{ ext.install('SAML', 'guacamole-auth-sso', 'saml/guacamole-auth-sso-saml') }}

(guac-saml-config)=

Configuration
-------------

{% call ext.config('saml') %}
The SAML authentication extension provides several configuration properties to
set it up to talk to the IdP. The SAML IdP also must be configured with
Guacamole as a Service Provider (SP). Configuration of the SAML IdP is beyond
the scope of this document, and will vary widely based on the IdP in use.
{% endcall %}

### Controlling login behavior

```{include} include/sso-login-behavior.md
```

#### Automatically redirecting all unauthenticated users

To ensure users are redirected to the SAML identity provider immediately
(without a Guacamole login screen), ensure the SAML extension has priority over
all others:

```
extension-priority: saml
```

#### Presenting unauthenticated users with a login screen

To ensure users are given a normal Guacamole login screen and have the option
to log in with traditional credentials _or_ with SAML, ensure the SAML
extension does not have priority:

```
extension-priority: *, saml
```

(saml-single-logout)=

### Single Logout (SLO)

By default, logging out of Guacamole will only terminate the Guacamole session,
leaving the user's session with the SAML Identity Provider intact. If the user
logs back in to Guacamole without the Identity Provider session having expired,
they will be transparently logged in to Guacamole without needing to re-enter
their credentials.

To enable Single Logout, configure the `saml-logout-endpoint` property with the
Identity Provider's logout endpoint. When configured, logging out of Guacamole
will redirect the user to the Identity Provider's logout endpoint, terminating
both the Guacamole session and the Identity Provider session.

#### Single Logout flow

When Single Logout is enabled, the logout flow proceeds as follows:

1. User initiates logout in Guacamole
2. Guacamole terminates the local session
3. User is redirected to the Identity Provider's logout endpoint
4. Identity Provider terminates the SSO session
5. User is redirected back to the URI specified by
   `saml-post-logout-redirect-uri` (or `saml-callback-url` if not specified)

The logout request to the Identity Provider includes the post-logout redirect
URI as the `RelayState` parameter, allowing the Identity Provider to redirect
the user back to Guacamole after the logout process is complete.

:::{important}
The `saml-post-logout-redirect-uri` (or `saml-callback-url` if used as the
fallback) may need to be registered with your Identity Provider as an allowed
post-logout redirect URI, depending on your IdP's requirements. Failure to
register this URI may result in an error from the Identity Provider or prevent
the redirect back to Guacamole after logout.
