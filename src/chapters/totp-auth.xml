    <para>Guacamole supports TOTP as a second authentication factor, layered on top of any other

        <para>The enrollment process used by Guacamole's TOTP support needs to be able to store an
            automatically-generated key within the user's account. Another extension must be
            installed which supports storage of arbitrary data from other extensions.
                <emphasis>Currently the only extensions provided with Guacamole which support this
                kind of storage are the <link linkend="jdbc-auth">database authentication
                    extensions</link>.</emphasis></para>
        <para>It is thus recommended that authentication against a database be fully configured
            prior to setting up TOTP. Instructions walking through the setup of database
            authentication for Guacamole are provided in <xref linkend="jdbc-auth"/>.</para>

        <title>How TOTP works with Guacamole</title>
        <para>Guacamole provides support for TOTP as a second authentication factor. To make use of
            the TOTP authentication extension, some other authentication mechanism will need be
            configured, as well. When a user attempts to log into Guacamole, other installed
            authentication methods will be queried first:</para>
        <informalfigure>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="images/totp-auth-factor-1.png" format="PNG"
                        contentwidth="2in"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalfigure>
        <para>Only after authentication has succeeded with one of those methods will Guacamole
            prompt the user to further verify their identity with an authentication code:</para>
        <informalfigure>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="images/totp-auth-factor-2.png" format="PNG"
                        contentwidth="4in"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalfigure>
        <para>If both the initial authentication attempt and verification using TOTP succeed, the
            user will be allowed in. If either mechanism fails, access to Guacamole is
            denied.</para>
        <section xml:id="totp-enrollment">
            <title>Enrollment</title>
            <para>If the user does not yet have a TOTP key associated with their account (they have
                not yet completed enrollment), they will be required to enroll an authentication
                device after passing the first authentication factor. A QR code containing an
                automatically-generated key will be presented to the user to be scanned by their
                authentication app or device:</para>

                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
            <para>If the authentication device does not support scanning QR codes for enrollment,
                the details within the QR code can be revealed by clicking the "Show" link next to
                the "Details" header. These values can then be entered manually:</para>

                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
            <para>Enrollment is completed once the user enters a valid authentication code generated
                by their device using the provided key.</para>
