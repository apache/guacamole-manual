    <para>While not strictly part of the Java API provided by the Guacamole project, guacamole-ext
        is an API exposed by the Guacamole web application within a separate project such that
        extensions, specifically authentication providers, can be written to tweak Guacamole to fit
        well in existing deployments.</para>
    <para>Extensions to Guacamole can:</para>

        <para>Guacamole extensions are standard Java <filename>.jar</filename> files which contain
            all classes and resources required by the extension, as well as the Guacamole extension
            manifest. There is no set structure to an extension except that the manifest must be in
            the root of the archive. Java classes and packages, if any, will be read from the
                <filename>.jar</filename> relative to the root, as well.</para>
        <para>Beyond this, the semantics and locations associated with all other resources within
            the extension are determined by the extension manifest alone.</para>

            <para>The Guacamole extension manifest is a single JSON file,
                    <filename>guac-manifest.json</filename>, which describes the location of each
                resource, the type of each resource, and the version of Guacamole that the extension
                was built for. The manifest can contain the following properties:</para>

                    contents of the HTTP request.</para>
                <para>The credentials given are abstract. While the Credentials object provides
                    convenience access to a traditional username and password,
                        <emphasis>implementations are not required to use usernames and
                        passwords</emphasis>. The entire contents of the HTTP request is at your
                    disposal, including parameters, cookies, and SSL information.</para>

                    extensions fail to authenticate the user, the contents of the exception thrown

                        the prompt for credentials for unauthenticated users is determined purely
                        based on the needs of the extension as declared within the authentication
                        failure itself.</emphasis></para>
                <para>If an authentication attempt succeeds, the extension returns an instance of

                <para>If authentication has succeeded, and thus an

                    authentication providers. Each extension now has the opportunity to provide
                    access to data for a user, even if that extension did not originally

                <para>The Guacamole interface will transparently unify the data from each extension,

            <para>Because authentication is decoupled from data storage/access, <emphasis>you do not
                    need to implement full-blown data storage if you only wish to provide an
                    additional authentication mechanism</emphasis>. You can instead implement only
                the authentication portion of an <classname>AuthenticationProvider</classname>, and
                otherwise rely on the storage and features provided by other extensions, such as the

        <para>The Guacamole web application includes a basic authentication provider implementation
            which parses an XML file to determine which users exist, their corresponding passwords,
            and what configurations those users have access to. This is the part of Guacamole that
            reads the <filename>user-mapping.xml</filename> file. If you use a custom authentication
            provider for your authentication, this file will probably not be required.</para>
        <para>The community has implemented authentication providers which access databases, use
            LDAP, or even perform no authentication at all, redirecting all users to a single
            configuration specified in <filename>guacamole.properties</filename>.</para>
        <para>A minimal authentication provider is implemented in the tutorials later, and the
            upstream authentication provider implemented within Guacamole, as well as the
            authentication providers implemented by the community, are good examples for how
            authentication can be extended without having to implement a whole new web
            application.</para>

            <title><classname>SimpleAuthenticationProvider</classname></title>
            <para>The <classname>SimpleAuthenticationProvider</classname> class provides a much
                simpler means of implementing authentication when you do not require the ability to
                add and remove users and connections. It is an abstract class and requires only one
                function implementation:
                <methodname>getAuthorizedConfigurations()</methodname>.</para>
            <para>This function is required to return a <classname>Map</classname> of unique IDs to

                required to use usernames and passwords.</para>
            <para>The configurations referred to by the function name are instances of
                    <classname>GuacamoleConfiguration</classname> (part of guacamole-common), which
                is just a wrapper around a protocol name and set of parameter name/value pairs. The
                name of the protocol to use and a set of parameters is the minimum information
                required for other parts of the Guacamole API to complete the handshake required by
                the Guacamole protocol.</para>
            <para>When a class that extends <classname>SimpleAuthenticationProvider</classname> is
                asked for more advanced operations by the web application,
                    <classname>SimpleAuthenticationProvider</classname> simply returns that there is
                no permission to do so. This effectively disables all administrative functionality
                within the web interface.</para>
