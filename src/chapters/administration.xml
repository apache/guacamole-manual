    <para>Users, connections, and active sessions can be administered from within the web interface
        if the underlying authentication module supports this. The only officially-supported
        authentication modules supporting this are the MySQL and PostgreSQL extensions, which are
        documented in <xref linkend="jdbc-auth"/>.</para>
    <para>If you are using the default authentication mechanism, or another authentication
        extension, this chapter probably does not apply to you, and the management options will not
        be visible in the Guacamole interface. If, on the other hand, you are using one of the
        database authentication providers, and you are logged in as a user with sufficient
        privileges, you will see management options within the user menu.</para>

            Here you can add new users or edit the properties and privileges of existing
            users.</para>
        <para>To add a new user, type the username of the new user within the text box inside the
            user management screen, and click the "New User" button. The new user will be added and
            made available. The new user will have no access to any existing connections, nor any
            administrative privileges, and you will need to manually set the user's password before
            they will be able to log in.</para>

        <para>To add a new connection or group, click the "New Connection" or "New Group" button.
            This will take you to a screen where you will be allowed to enter the details of the new
            object, such as its location, parameters, and name. This name should be descriptive, but
            must also be unique with respect to other connections or groups in the same
            location.</para>
        <para>Once you click "Save", the new object will be added, but will initially only be usable
            by administrators and your current user. To grant another user access to the new

            connection or group you created.</para>

            <title>Connection organization and balancing</title>
            <para>Connection groups can be either "organizational" or "balancing". Each group can
                contain any number of other connections or groups, but the semantics of the group
                change depending on the type.</para>
            <para>An organizational group behaves exactly as a folder or directory in a file system.
                It simply contains connections and other groups, but provides no other behavior.
                Clicking on an organizational group within a connection list will expand the group,
                revealing its contents.</para>
            <para>A balancing group behaves as a connection. It dynamically balances load across the
                connections it contains, choosing the connection with the fewest number of active
                users. Unlike organizational groups, clicking on a balancing group causes a new
                connection to be opened. The actual underlying connection used depends on which
                connection has the least load at the time the group was clicked.</para>

        <para>Clicking "Active Sessions" navigates to the session management screen. The session
            management screen displays all active sessions and allows system administrators to kill

        <para>When any user accesses a particular remote desktop connection, a unique session is
            created and will appear in the list of active sessions in the session management screen.
            Each active session is displayed in a sortable table, showing the corresponding user's
            username, how long the session has been active, the IP address of the machine from which
            the user is connecting, and the name of the connection being used.</para>

        <section xml:id="filtering-sessions">
            <title>Filtering and sorting</title>
            <para>The table can be resorted by clicking on the column headers. Clicking any column
                will resort the table by the values within that column, while clicking a column
                which is already sorted will toggle between ascending and descending order.</para>
            <para>The content of the table can be limited through filters entered in the "Filter"
                input field. Entering a word or phrase in quotes will limit the table to only those
                sessions which contain at least one column matching that word or phrase. For
                example, to list only connections by the user "guacadmin" which have been active
                since March, 2015, you would enter: "guacadmin 2015-03".</para>
            <para>If you wish to narrow the content of the table to only those connections which
                originate from a particular block of IP addresses, you can do this by specifying the
                block with standard CIDR notation, such "10.0.0.0/8" or "2001:db8:1234::/48". This
                will work with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</para>
