    <title>Proxying Guacamole</title>
    <para>Like most web applications, Guacamole can be placed behind a reverse proxy. For production
        deployments of Guacamole, this is <emphasis>highly recommended</emphasis>. It provides
        flexibility and, if your proxy is properly configured for SSL, encryption.</para>
    <para>Proxying isolates privileged operations within native applications that can safely drop
        those privileges when no longer needed, using Java only for unprivileged tasks. On Linux and
        UNIX systems, a process must be running with root privileges to listen on any port under
        1024, including the standard HTTP and HTTPS ports (80 and 443 respectively). If the servlet
        container instead listens on a higher port, such as the default port 8080, it can run as a
        reduced-privilege user, allowing the reverse proxy to bear the burden of root privileges. As
        a native application, the reverse proxy can make system calls to safely drop root privileges
        once the port is open; a Java application like Tomcat cannot do this.</para>
    <section xml:id="preparing-servlet-container">
        <title>Preparing your servlet container</title>
        <para>Your servlet container is most likely already configured to listen for HTTP
            connections on port 8080 as this is the default. If this is the case, and you can
            already access Guacamole over port 8080 from a web browser, you need not make any
            further changes to its configuration.</para>
        <para>If you <emphasis>have</emphasis> changed this, perhaps with the intent of proxying
            Guacamole over AJP, <emphasis>change it back</emphasis>. Using Guacamole over AJP is
            unsupported as it is known to cause problems, namely:</para>

            <title>Setting up the Remote IP Valve</title>
            <para>By default, when Tomcat is behind a reverse proxy, the remote IP address of the
                client that it sees is that of the proxy rather than the original client.  In order
                to allow applications hosted within Tomcat, like Guacmaole, to see the actual IP
                address of the client, you have to configure both the reverse proxy and Tomcat.</para>
            <para>Because the remote IP address in Guacamole is used for auditing of user logins and
                connections and could potentially be used for authentication, it is important that you
                are either in direct control of the proxy server or you explicitly trust it.  Passing
                the remote IP address is done using the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header, and,
                as with most HTTP headers, attackers can attempt to spoof this header in order to
                manipulate the behavior of the web server, gain unauthorized access to the system,
                or attempt to disguise the host or IP address they are coming from.</para>
            <para>One final caveat: This may not work as expected if there are other upstream proxy
                servers between your reverse proxy and the clients access Guacamole.  Other proxies
                or firewalls can mask the IP address of the client, and if the configuration of
                those is not within your control you may end up with multiple clients appearing to
                come from the same IP address or host.  Make sure you take this into account when
                configuring the system and looking at the data provided.</para>
            <para>Configuring Tomcat to pass through the remote IP address provided by the reverse
                proxy in the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header requires the configuration of what
                Tomcat calls a Valve.  In this case, it is the <code>RemoteIpValve</code> and is
                configured in the <filename>conf/server.xml</filename> file, in the
                <code>&lt;Host/></code>section:</para>

            </informalexample>
            <para>The <parameter>internalProxies</parameter> value should be set to the IP address
                or addresses of any and all reverse proxy servers that will be accessing this Tomcat
                instance directly.  Often it is run on the same system that runs Tomcat, but in other
                cases (for example, when running Docker), it may be on a different system/container and
                may need to be set to the actual IP address of the reverse proxy system.  Only proxy
                servers listed in the <parameter>internalProxies</parameter> or
                <parameter>trustedProxies</parameter> parameters will be allowed to manipulate the
                remote IP address information.  The other parameters in this configuration line allow

                    the section for <uri>/guacamole/</uri> will match instead, and WebSocket will
                    not be proxied correctly.</para>

            <title>Changing the path</title>
            <para>If you wish to serve Guacamole through Apache under a path other than
                    <uri>/guacamole/</uri>, the configuration required for Apache will be slightly
                different than the examples above due to cookies.</para>
            <para>Guacamole does not rely on receipt of cookies for tracking whether a user is
                logged in, but cookies are required for the proper operation of the HTTP tunnel. If
                the HTTP tunnel is used, and cookies cannot be set, users will be unexpectedly
                denied access to connections they legitimately should have access to.</para>
            <para>Cookies are set using the absolute path of the web application
                    (<uri>/guacamole/</uri>). If this path differs from that used by Apache, the
                path in the cookie needs to be modified using the
                    <parameter>ProxyPassReverseCookiePath</parameter> directive:</para>
            <informalexample>
                <programlisting>&lt;Location /<replaceable>new-path/</replaceable>>
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    ProxyPass http://<replaceable>HOSTNAME</replaceable>:<replaceable>8080</replaceable>/guacamole/ flushpackets=on
    ProxyPassReverse http://<replaceable>HOSTNAME</replaceable>:<replaceable>8080</replaceable>/guacamole/
    <emphasis>ProxyPassReverseCookiePath /guacamole/ /<replaceable>new-path/</replaceable></emphasis>
&lt;/Location>

&lt;Location /<replaceable>new-path</replaceable>/websocket-tunnel>
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    ProxyPass ws://<replaceable>HOSTNAME</replaceable>:<replaceable>8080</replaceable>/guacamole/websocket-tunnel
    ProxyPassReverse ws://<replaceable>HOSTNAME</replaceable>:<replaceable>8080</replaceable>/guacamole/websocket-tunnel
&lt;/Location></programlisting>
            </informalexample>
            <para>This directive is not needed for the WebSocket section, as it is not applicable.
                Cookies are only used by Guacamole within the HTTP tunnel.</para>

        <section xml:id="disable-tunnel-logging">
            <title>Disabling logging of tunnel requests</title>
            <para>If WebSocket is unavailable, Guacamole will fallback to using an HTTP-based
                tunnel. The Guacamole HTTP tunnel works by transferring a continuous stream of data
                over multiple short-lived streams, each associated with a separate HTTP request. By
                default, Apache will log each of these requests, resulting in a rather bloated
                access log.</para>
            <para>There is little value in a log file filled with identical tunnel requests, so it
                is recommended to explicitly disable logging of those requests. Apache does provide
                a means of matching URL patterns and setting environment variables based on whether
                the URL matches. Logging can then be restricted to requests which lack this
                environment variable:</para>
            <informalexample>
                <programlisting>SetEnvIf Request_URI "^<replaceable>/guacamole</replaceable>/tunnel" dontlog
CustomLog  <replaceable>/var/log/apache2/guac.log</replaceable> common env=!dontlog</programlisting>
            </informalexample>
            <para>Note that if you are serving Guacamole under a path different from
                    <uri>/guacamole/</uri>, you will need to change the value of
                    <parameter>Request_URI</parameter> above accordingly.</para>
