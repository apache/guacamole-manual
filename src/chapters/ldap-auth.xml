    <para>Guacamole supports LDAP authentication via an extension available from the main project
        website. This extension allows users and connections to be stored directly within an LDAP
        directory. If you have a centralized authentication system that uses LDAP, Guacamole's LDAP
        support can be a good way to allow your users to use their existing usernames and passwords
        to log into Guacamole.</para>
    <para>To use the LDAP authentication extension, you will need:</para>
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>An LDAP directory as storage for all authentication data, such as OpenLDAP.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>The ability to modify the schema of your LDAP directory.</para>
        </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>The instructions here assume you already have an LDAP directory installed and working, and
        do not cover the initial setup of such a directory.</para>
    <important>
        <para>This chapter involves modifying the contents of <varname>GUACAMOLE_HOME</varname> -
            the Guacamole configuration directory. If you are unsure where
                <varname>GUACAMOLE_HOME</varname> is located on your system, please consult <xref
                linkend="configuring-guacamole"/> before proceeding.</para>

        <title>How Guacamole uses LDAP</title>
        <para>If the LDAP extension is installed, Guacamole will authenticate users against your
            LDAP server by attempting a bind as that user. The given username and password will be
            submitted to the LDAP server during the bind attempt.</para>
        <para>If the bind attempt is successful, the set of available Guacamole connections is
            queried from the LDAP directory by executing an LDAP query as the bound user. Each
            Guacamole connection is represented within the directory as a special type of group:
                <classname>guacConfigGroup</classname>. Attributes associated with the group define
            the protocol and parameters of the connection, and users are allowed access to the
            connection only if they are associated with that group.</para>
        <para>This architecture has a number of benefits:</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Your users can use their existing usernames and passwords to log into
                    Guacamole.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>You can manage Guacamole connections using the same tool that you already use
                    to manage your LDAP directory, such as <link

                    connections.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Access to connections can easily be granted and revoked, as each connection is
                    represented by a group.</para>

        </orderedlist>
        <important>
            <para>Though Guacamole connections can be stored within the LDAP directory, this is not
                required. Connection data can alternatively be stored within a database like MySQL
                or PostgreSQL as long as the LDAP username matches the username of the database
                user. Configuring Guacamole to use a database for authentication or connection
                storage is covered in <xref linkend="jdbc-auth"/> and later in this chapter in <xref

        <para>Although your LDAP directory already provides a means of storing and authenticating
            users, Guacamole also needs storage of connection configuration data, such as hostnames
            and ports, and a means of associating users with connections that they should have
            access to. You can do this either through modifying the LDAP directory schema, or
            through using a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL. If you do not wish to use the LDAP
            directory for connection storage, skip ahead to <xref linkend="ldap-and-database"

                <classname>guacConfigGroup</classname>, which contains all configuration information
            for a particular connection, and can be associated with arbitrarily-many users and
            groups. Each connection defined by a <classname>guacConfigGroup</classname> will be

                check the logs. Problems in the configuration of the LDAP extension will prevent
                Guacamole from starting up, and any such errors will be recorded in the logs of your
                servlet container. If properly configured, you will be able to log in as any user

        <para>Guacamole's LDAP support allows users and connections to be managed purely within an
            LDAP directory defined in <filename>guacamole.properties</filename>. This is
            accomplished with a minimum of changes to the standard LDAP schema - all Guacamole users
            are traditional LDAP users and share the same mechanism of authentication. The only new
            type of object required is a representation for Guacamole connections,
                <classname>guacConfigGroup</classname>, which was added to your server's schema
            during the install process above.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Users</title>
            <para>All Guacamole users, as far as the LDAP support is concerned, are LDAP users with
                standard LDAP credentials. When a user signs in to Guacamole, their username and
                password will be used to bind to the LDAP server. If this bind operation is
                successful, the available connections are queried from the directory and the user is
                allowed in.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Connections and parameters</title>
            <para>Each connection is represented by an instance of the
                    <classname>guacConfigGroup</classname> object class, an extended version of the
                standard LDAP <classname>groupOfNames</classname>, which provides a protocol and set
                of parameters. Only members of the <classname>guacConfigGroup</classname> will have
                access to the corresponding connection.</para>
            <para>The <classname>guacConfigGroup</classname> object class provides two new
                attributes in addition to those provided by
                <classname>groupOfNames</classname>:</para>
            <variablelist>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term><property>guacConfigProtocol</property></term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The protocol associated with the connection, such as
                                "<constant>vnc</constant>" or "<constant>rdp</constant>". This
                            attribute is required for every <classname>guacConfigGroup</classname>
                            and can be given only once.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </varlistentry>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term><property>guacConfigParameter</property></term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The name and value of a parameter for the specified protocol. This is
                            given as
                                    <code><replaceable>name</replaceable>=<replaceable>value</replaceable></code>,
                            where "name" is the name of the parameter, as defined by the
                            documentation for the protocol specified, and "value" is any allowed
                            value for that parameter.</para>
                        <para>This attribute can be given multiple times for the same
                            connection.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </varlistentry>
            </variablelist>
            <para>For example, to create a new VNC connection which connects to "localhost" at port
                5900, while granting access to <systemitem>user1</systemitem> and
                    <systemitem>user2</systemitem>, you could create an <filename>.ldif</filename>
                file like the following:</para>
            <informalexample>
                <programlisting>dn: cn=Example Connection,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=net
objectClass: guacConfigGroup
objectClass: groupOfNames
cn: Example Connection
guacConfigProtocol: vnc
guacConfigParameter: hostname=localhost
guacConfigParameter: port=5900
guacConfigParameter: password=secret
member: cn=user1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=net
member: cn=user2,ou=people,dc=example,dc=net</programlisting>
            </informalexample>
            <para>The new connection can then be created using the <command>ldapadd</command>
                utility:</para>
            <informalexample>
                <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>ldapadd -x -D <replaceable>cn=admin,dc=example,dc=net</replaceable> -W -f <replaceable>example-connection.ldif</replaceable></userinput>
<computeroutput>Enter LDAP Password:
adding new entry "cn=Example Connection,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=net"
</computeroutput>
<prompt>$</prompt></screen>
            </informalexample>
            <para>Where <systemitem>cn=admin,dc=example,dc=net</systemitem> is an administrator
                account with permission to create new entries, and
                    <filename>example-connection.ldif</filename> is the name of the
                    <filename>.ldif</filename> file you just created.</para>
            <para>There is, of course, no need to use only the standard LDAP utilities to create
                connections and users. There are useful graphical environments for manipulating LDAP
                directories, such as <link xlink:href="https://directory.apache.org/studio/">Apache
                    Directory Studio</link>, which make many of the tasks given above much
                easier.</para>
