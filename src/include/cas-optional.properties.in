# If using CAS ClearPass to pass the SSO password to Guacamole, this parameter

cas-clearpass-key: /path/to/private-key.pem

#
# The CAS attribute that determines group membership, typically "memberOf".
# This parameter is only required if using CAS to define user group memberships.
# If omitted, groups aren't retrieved from CAS, and all other group-related
# properties for CAS are ignored.
#
cas-group-attribute: memberOf

#
# The format that CAS will use for its group names. Possible values are
# `plain`, for groups that are simple text names, or `ldap`, for groups that are
# represented as LDAP DNs. If set to `ldap`, group names are always determined
# from the last (leftmost) attribute of the DN. If omitted, `plain` is used by
# default.
#
# This property has no effect if cas-group-attribute is not set.
#
cas-group-format: plain

#
# The base DN to require for LDAP-formatted CAS groups. If specified, only CAS
# groups beneath this DN will be included, and all other CAS groups will be
# ignored.
#
# This property has no effect if cas-group-format is not `ldap`.
#
cas-group-ldap-base-dn: ou=groups,dc=example,dc=net

#
# The LDAP attribute to require for LDAP-formatted CAS groups. If specified,
# only CAS groups that use this attribute for the name of the group will be
# included. Note that LDAP group names are *always determined from the last
# (leftmost) attribute of the DN*. Specifying this property will only have the
# effect of ignoring any groups that do not use the specified attribute to
# represent the group name.
#
# This property has no effect if cas-group-format is not `ldap`.
