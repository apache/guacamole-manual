#
# A comma-separated list of IP addresses or subnets (in CIDR notation) that
# should be allowed to authenticate using encrypted JSON authentication. If
# set, _only_ machines with IP addresses that match the addresses/subnets in
# this list will be allowed to authenticate in this way. All other attempts to
# authenticate with encrypted JSON authentication will fail, regardless of
# whether the JSON is correctly signed and encrypted.
#
# By default, no restriction is placed on which machines may attempt to use
# encrypted JSON authentication.
