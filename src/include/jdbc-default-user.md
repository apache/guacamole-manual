The default Guacamole user created by the provided SQL scripts is
"`guacadmin`", with a default password of "`guacadmin`". Once you have verified
that the database authentication is working, **you should [change your password
immediately](changing-password)**.

Once you have successfully logged in and changed your password, you can begin
using the web UI to create other users, groups, and connections. More detailed
instructions for doing this are given in [](administration).
