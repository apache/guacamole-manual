# Whether time-based access windows should be enforced for active user sessions.
# By default, users will be logged out when an access window closes, even if
# they are currently logged in. To allow logged-in users to continue to use the
# application after an access window closes, set this to "false". Users will
# always be prevented from logging in outside of access windows regardless of
# this setting.
