#
# The hostname or IP address of the server hosting your database. If not
# specified, "localhost" will be used by default.
#
postgresql-hostname: localhost

#
# The port number of the PostgreSQL database to connect to. If not specified,
# the standard PostgreSQL port 5432 will be used.
#
postgresql-port: 5432

#
# This property sets the SSL mode that the JDBC extension will attempt to use
# when communicating with the remote PostgreSQL server. The values for this
# property match the standard values supported by the PostgreSQL JDBC driver:
#
# disable
# : Do not use SSL, and fail if the server requires it.
#
# allow
# : If the server requires encryption use it, otherwise prefer unencrypted
#   connections.
#
# prefer
# : Try SSL connections, first, but allow unencrypted connections if the server
#   does not support SSL or if SSL negotiations fail. This is the
#   default.
#
# require
# : Require SSL connections, but implicitly trust all server certificates and
#   authorities.
#
# verify-ca
# : Require SSL connections, and verify that the server certificate is issued
#   by a known certificate authority.
#
# verify-full
# : Require SSL connections, verifying that the server certificate is issued
#   by a known authority, and that the name on the certificate matches the name
#   of the server.
#
postgresql-ssl-mode: prefer

#
# The file containing the client certificate to be used when making an
# SSL-encrtyped connection to the PostgreSQL server, in PEM format. This
# property is optional, and will be ignored if the SSL mode is set to disable.
#
postgresql-ssl-cert-file: /etc/guacamole/postgresql.crt

#
# The file containing the client private key to be used when making an
# SSL-encrypted connection to the PostgreSQL server, in PEM format. This
# property is optional, and will be ignored if the SSL mode is set to disable.
#
postgresql-ssl-key-file: /etc/guacamole/postgresql.key

#
# The file containing the root and intermedidate certificates against which the
# server certificate will be verified when making an SSL-encrypted connection
# to the PostgreSQL server. This file should contain one or more PEM-formatted
# authority certificates. This property is optional, and will only be used if
# SSL mode is set to verify-ca or verify-full.
#
# If SSL is set to one of the verification modes and this property is not
# specified, the JDBC driver will attempt to use the `.postgresql/root.crt`
# file from the home directory of the user running the web application server
# (e.g. Tomcat). If this property is not specified and the default file does
# not exist, the PostgreSQL JDBC driver will fail to connect to the server.
#
postgresql-ssl-root-cert-file: /etc/guacamole/postgresql-root.crt

#
# The password that will be used to access the client private key file, if the
# client private key is encrypted. This property is optional, and is only used
# if the `postgresql-ssl-key-file` property is set and SSL is enabled.
#
postgresql-ssl-key-password: some-password

#
# The number of seconds the driver will wait for a response from the database,
# before aborting the query. A value of 0 (the default) means the timeout is
# disabled.
#
postgresql-default-statement-timeout: 0

#
# The number of seconds to wait for socket read operations. If reading from the
# server takes longer than this value, the connection will be closed. This can
# be used to handle network problems such as a dropped connection to the
# database. Similar to `postgresql-default-statement-timeout`, it will also
# abort queries that take too long. A value of 0 (the default) means the
# timeout is disabled.
#
postgresql-socket-timeout: 0

#
# Controls how many objects may be retrieved from the database in a single
# query. If more objects than this number are requested, retrieval of those
# objects will be automatically and transparently split across multiple
# queries.
#
# By default, PostgreSQL queries will retrieve no more than 5000 objects.
#
postgresql-batch-size: 5000
