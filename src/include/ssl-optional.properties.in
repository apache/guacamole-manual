#
# The name of the header to use to retrieve the URL-encoded client certificate
# from an HTTP request received from an SSL termination service providing
# SSL/TLS client authentication. The certificate must be in PEM format.
#
# By default, the `X-Client-Certificate` header will be used.
#
ssl-auth-client-certificate-header: X-Client-Certificate

#
# The name of the header to use to retrieve the verification status of the
# certificate an HTTP request received from an SSL termination service
# providing SSL/TLS client authentication.
#
# The value of this header must be "SUCCESS" (all uppercase) if the certificate
# was successfully verified. The full set of accepted values that your reverse
# proxy should submit for this header is:
#
# `SUCCESS`
# : Client certificate verification succeeded.
#
# {samp}`FAILED: {reason}`
# : Client certificate verification failed for the given reason (a
#   human-readable description).
#
# `NONE`
# : No client certificate was present.
#
# This matches the values used by both the Apache HTTP Server and Nginx. Any
# value not shown above is interpreted as an authentication failure.
#
# By default, the `X-Client-Verified` header will be used.
#
ssl-auth-client-verified-header: X-Client-Verified

#
# The amount of time that a temporary authentication token for SSL/TLS
# authentication may remain valid, in minutes.
#
# This token is used to represent the user's asserted identity after it has
# been verified by the SSL termination service. This interval must be long
# enough to allow for network delays in receiving the token, but short enough
# that unused tokens do not consume unnecessary server resources and cannot
# potentially be guessed while the token is still valid. These tokens are
# 256-bit secure random values.
#
# By default, tokens are valid for 5 minutes.
#
ssl-auth-max-token-validity: 5

#
# The LDAP attribute or attributes that may be used to represent a username
# within the subject DN of a user's X.509 certificate. If the least-significant
# attribute of the subject DN is not one of these attributes, the certificate
# will be rejected.
#
# By default, any attribute is accepted (the least-significant attribute of the
# subject DN is used as the username, regardless of what attribute that may
# be).
#
ssl-auth-subject-username-attribute: cn, uid

#
# The base DN containing all valid subject DNs. If specified, only certificates
# asserting subject DNs beneath this base DN will be accepted.
#
# By default, all DNs are accepted.
#
ssl-auth-subject-base-dn: ou=Users,dn=example,dn=net

#
# The amount of time that the temporary, unique subdomain generated for SSL/TLS
# authentication may remain valid, in minutes. This subdomain is used to ensure
# each SSL/TLS authentication attempt is fresh and does not potentially reuse a
# previous authentication attempt that was cached by the browser or OS. This
# interval must be long enough to allow for network delays in authenticating
# the user with the SSL termination service that enforces SSL/TLS client
# authentication, but short enough that an unused domain does not consume
# unnecessary server resources and cannot potentially be guessed while that
# subdomain is still valid. These subdomains are 128-bit secure random values.
#
# By default, generated domains are valid for 5 minutes.
