#
# The URI of the XML metadata file from the SAML Identity Provider that
# contains all of the information the SAML extension needs in order to know how
# to authenticate with the IdP. This URI can either be a remote server (e.g.
# `https://`) or a local file on the filesystem (e.g. `file://`). Often the
# metadata file contains most of the required properties for SAML
# authentication and the other parameters are not required.
#
saml-idp-metadata-url: file:///etc/guacamole/saml-metadata.xml

#
# The base URL of the SAML IdP. This is the URL that the SAML authentication
# extension will use to redirect when requesting SAML authentication. If the
# `saml-idp-metadata-url` property is provided, this parameter will be ignored.
# If the metadata file is not provided this property is required.
#
saml-idp-url: https://myidp.example.net

#
# The entity ID of the Guacamole SAML client, which is generally the URL of the
# Guacamole server, but is not required to be so. This property is required if
# either the `saml-idp-metadata-url` property is not specified, or if the
# provided metadata file does not contain the SAML SP Entity ID for the
# Guacamole Client.
#
saml-entity-id: https://guac.example.net

#
# The URL that the IdP will use once authentication has succeeded to return to
# the Guacamole web application and provide the authentication details to the
# SAML extension. The SAML extension currently only supports callback as a POST
# operation to this callback URL. This property is required.
#
saml-callback-url: https://guac.example.net

#
# Require strict security checks during SAML logins. This will insure that
# valid certificates are present for all interactions with SAML servers and
# fail SAML authentication if security restrictions are violated. This property
# is optional, and will default to true, requiring strict security checks. This
# property should only be set to false in non-production environments during
# testing of SAML authentication.
#
saml-strict: true

#
# Enable additional logging within the supporting SAML library that can assist
# in tracking down issues during SAML logins. This property is optional, and
# will default to false (no debugging).
#
saml-debug: false

#
# Enable compression of the HTTP requests sent to the SAML IdP. This property
# is optional and will default to true (compression enabled).
#
saml-compress-request: true

#
# Request that the SAML response returned by the IdP be compressed. This
# property is optional and will default to true (compression will be
# requested).
#
saml-compress-response: true

#
# The name of the attribute provided by the SAML IdP that contains group
# membership of the user. These groups will be parsed and used to map group
# membership of the user logging in, which can be used for permissions
# management within Guacamole Client, particularly when layered with other
# authentication modules. This property is optional, and defaults to "groups".
#
saml-group-attribute: groups

#
# The path to a certificate that will be used to sign SAML requests before
# they are sent to the IdP, enhancing the integrity of the SAML authentication
# process. This property is optional, and, if not present, SAML requests
# will not be signed.
#
saml-x509-cert-path: /etc/guacamole/myidp.crt

#
# The path to a private key file to use to encrypt SAML requests sent to the
# IdP, enhancing the confidentiality and integrity of the authentication
# process. This property is optional, and, if not present, SAML requests
# will not be encrypted before they are sent to the IdP.
