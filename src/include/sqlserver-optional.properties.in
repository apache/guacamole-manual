# : The current [Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/download-microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server),
#   supporting SQL Server 2005 and later. This is the default.
#

# : The open source [jTDS](http://jtds.sourceforge.net/) driver.
#
# datadirect

#
sqlserver-driver: microsoft2005

#
# The instance name that the SQL Server driver should attempt to connect to, if
# not the default SQL Server instance. This instance name is configured during

#
sqlserver-instance: MSSQLSERVER

#
# Controls how many objects may be retrieved from the database in a single
# query. If more objects than this number are requested, retrieval of those

#
sqlserver-batch-size: 500
