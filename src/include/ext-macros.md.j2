Guacamole is configured differently depending on whether Guacamole was
[installed natively](installing-guacamole) or [using the provided Docker
images](guacamole-docker). The documentation here covers both methods.

::::{tab} {{ native_tab_title }}
Native installations of Guacamole under [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/)
or similar are configured by modifying the contents of `GUACAMOLE_HOME`
([Guacamole's configuration directory](guacamole-home)), which is located at
`/etc/guacamole` by default and may need to be created first:

{%- if caller is defined %}
{{ caller() }}
{%- else %}
1. Download {{ downloadLink(extArchiveName) }} from [the release page for
   Apache Guacamole {{ version }}](https://guacamole.apache.org/releases/{{ version }})
   and extract it.

2. Create the `GUACAMOLE_HOME/extensions` directory, if it does not already
   exist.

3. Copy the `{{ extJarName }}-{{ version }}.jar` file from the contents of the
   archive to `GUACAMOLE_HOME/extensions/`.

4. Proceed with the configuring Guacamole for the newly installed extension as
   described below. The extension will be loaded after Guacamole has been
   restarted.
{%- endif %}

:::{note}
Download and documentation links for all officially supported extensions for a
particular version of Guacamole are always provided in the release notes for
that version. The copy of the documentation you are reading now is from [Apache
Guacamole {{ version }}](https://guacamole.apache.org/releases/{{ version }}).

**If you are using a different version of Guacamole, please locate that version
within [the release archives](https://guacamole.apache.org/releases/) and
consult the documentation for that release instead.**
:::

::::{tab} {{ container_tab_title }}
    {%- if dockerDefault %}
**This extension is enabled by default when using the Docker image.** You do
not need to do anything to use this extension with Docker unless you wish to
override the default behavior. If you _don't_ wish to use this extension, you
can disable it by setting `{{ extVarPrefix }}_ENABLED` to `false`.

If deploying Guacamole using Docker Compose:
: This is accomplished by adding the `{{ extVarPrefix }}_ENABLED` environment
  variable to the `environment` section of your `guacamole/guacamole` container:

  ```yaml
  {{ extVarPrefix }}_ENABLED: "false"
  ```

If instead deploying Guacamole by running `docker run` manually:
: This extension can be disabled by providing the same environment variable
  using the `-e` option. For example:

  ```console
  $ docker run --name some-guacamole \
      -e {{ extVarPrefix }}_ENABLED="false" \
      -d -p 8080:8080 guacamole/guacamole
  ```
    {%- else %}
Docker installations of Guacamole include a bundled copy of [Apache
Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) and are configured using environment
variables. The startup process of the Docker image automatically populates
`GUACAMOLE_HOME` ([Guacamole's configuration directory](guacamole-home)) based
on the values of these variables.

If deploying Guacamole using Docker Compose:
: You will need to add at least one relevant environment variable to the
  `environment` section of your `guacamole/guacamole` container, such as the
  `{{ extVarPrefix }}_ENABLED` environment variable:

  ```yaml
  {{ extVarPrefix }}_ENABLED: "true"
  ```

If instead deploying Guacamole by running `docker run` manually:
: The same environment variable(s) will need to be provided using the `-e`
  option. For example:

  ```console
  $ docker run --name some-guacamole \
      -e {{ extVarPrefix }}_ENABLED="true" \
      -d -p 8080:8080 guacamole/guacamole
  ```
    {%- endif %}

If `{{ extVarPrefix }}_ENABLED` is set to `false`, the extension will NOT be
installed, even if other related environment variables have been set. This can
be used to temporarily disable usage of an extension without needing to remove
all other related configuration.

You don't strictly need to set `{{ extVarPrefix }}_ENABLED` if other related
environment variables are provided, but the extension will be installed only if
at least _one_ related environment variable is set.
