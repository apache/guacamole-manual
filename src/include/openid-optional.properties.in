#
# The space-separated list of OpenID scopes to request. OpenID scopes determine
# the information returned within the OpenID token, and thus affect what values
# can be used as an authenticated user's username.  To be compliant with
# OpenID, at least "`openid profile`" must be requested. By default, "`openid
# email profile`" is used.

#
# The amount of clock skew tolerated for timestamp comparisons between the
# Guacamole server and OpenID service clocks, in seconds. By default, clock
# skew of up to 30 seconds is tolerated.

openid-allowed-clock-skew: 30

#
# The maximum amount of time that an OpenID token should remain valid, in
# minutes. By default, each OpenID token remains valid for 300 minutes (5
# hours).
#
openid-max-token-validity: 300

#
# The maximum amount of time that a nonce generated by the Guacamole server
# should remain valid, in minutes. As each OpenID request has a unique nonce
# value, this imposes an upper limit on the amount of time any particular
# OpenID request can result in successful authentication within Guacamole. By
# default, each generated nonce expires after 10 minutes.

#
# The logout endpoint (URI) of the OpenID Connect identity provider. When
# configured, users will be redirected to this endpoint when they log out from
# Guacamole, allowing them to also log out from the identity provider (Single
# Logout). If not set, logout will only terminate the Guacamole session without
# affecting the identity provider session.
#
# This value should be provided to you by the identity provider. For identity
# providers that implement [OpenID Connect
# Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html), this
# value can be retrieved from the `end_session_endpoint` property of the JSON
# file hosted at
# {samp}`{https://identity-provider}/.well-known/openid-configuration`, where
# `https://identity-provider` is the base URL of the identity provider.
#
openid-logout-endpoint: https://identity-provider/logout

#
# The URI that the OpenID Connect identity provider should redirect to after
# logout is complete. This must be registered with your identity provider as an
# allowed post-logout redirect URI. If not specified, the value of
# `openid-redirect-uri` will be used.
