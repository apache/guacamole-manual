# The space-separated list of OpenID scopes to request. OpenID scopes determine
# the information returned within the OpenID token, and thus affect what values
# can be used as an authenticated user's username.  To be compliant with
# OpenID, at least "`openid profile`" must be requested. By default, "`openid
# email profile`" is used.

# The amount of clock skew tolerated for timestamp comparisons between the

# skew of up to 30 seconds is tolerated.

# The maximum amount of time that an OpenID token should remain valid, in
# minutes. By default, each OpenID token remains valid for 300 minutes (5
# hours).
#
openid-max-token-validity: 300

#
# The maximum amount of time that a nonce generated by the Guacamole server
# should remain valid, in minutes. As each OpenID request has a unique nonce
# value, this imposes an upper limit on the amount of time any particular
# OpenID request can result in successful authentication within Guacamole. By
# default, each generated nonce expires after 10 minutes.
