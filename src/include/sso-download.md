Guacamole's SSO extensions are available separately from the main
`guacamole.war`. The link for this and all other officially-supported and
compatible extensions for a particular version of Guacamole are provided on the
release notes for that version. You can find the release notes for current
versions of Guacamole here: <http://guacamole.apache.org/releases/>.

The SSO extensions are packaged together in a `.tar.gz` file containing one
extension for each supported SSO method:

| SSO Method                    | Extension                                    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [CAS](cas-auth)               | `cas/guacamole-auth-sso-cas-1.5.5.jar`       |
| [OpenID Connect](openid-auth) | `openid/guacamole-auth-sso-openid-1.5.5.jar` |
| [SAML](saml-auth)             | `saml/guacamole-auth-sso-saml-1.5.5.jar`     |
