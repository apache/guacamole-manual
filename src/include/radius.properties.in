#
# The RADIUS server to authenticate against. If not specified, localhost will
# be used.
#
radius-hostname: localhost

#
# The RADIUS authentication port on which the RADIUS service is is listening.
# If not specified, the default of 1812 will be used.
#
radius-auth-port: 1812

#
# The shared secret to use when talking to the RADIUS server. This parameter is
# required and the extension will not load if this is not specified.
#
radius-shared-secret: some-shared-secret

#
# The authentication protocol to use when talking to the RADIUS server. This
# parameter is required for the extension to operate. Supported values are:
# pap, chap, mschapv1, mschapv2, eap-md5, eap-tls, and eap-ttls. Support for
# PEAP is implemented inside the extension, but, due to a regression in the
# JRadius implementation, it is currently broken. Also, if you specify eap-ttls
# you will also need to specify the `radius-eap-ttls-inner-protocol` parameter
# in order to properly configure the protocol used inside the EAP TTLS tunnel.
#
radius-auth-protocol: eap-tls

#
# The combination certificate and private key pair to use for TLS-based RADIUS
# protocols that require a client-side certificate. This parameter should specify
# the absolute path to the file. By default the extension will look for a file
# called `radius.key` in the `GUACAMOLE_HOME` directory.
#
radius-key-file: /etc/guacamole/radius.key

#
# The file type of the keystore specified by the `radius-key-file` parameter.
# Valid keystore types are pem, jceks, jks, and pkcs12. If not specified, this
# defaults to pkcs12, the default used by the JRadius library.
#
radius-key-type: pkcs12

#
# The password of the private key specified in the `radius-key-file` parameter.
# By default the extension will not use any password when trying to open the
# key file.
#
radius-key-password: some-password

#
# The absolute path to the file that stores the certificate authority
# certificates for encrypted connections to the RADIUS server. By default a
# file with the name ca.crt in the `GUACAMOLE_HOME` directory will be used.
#
radius-ca-file: /etc/guacamole/ca.crt

#
# The file type of the keystore used for the certificate authority. Valid
# formats are pem, jceks, jks, and pkcs12. If not specified this defaults to
# pem.
#
radius-ca-type: pem

#
# The password used to protect the certificate authority store, if any.  If
# unspecified the extension will attempt to read the CA store without any
# password.
#
radius-ca-password: some-password

#
# This parameter controls whether or not the RADIUS extension should trust all
# certificates or verify them against known good certificate authorities. Set
# to true to allow the RADIUS server to connect without validating
# certificates. The default is false, which causes certificates to be
# validated.
#
radius-trust-all: false

#
# The number of times the client will retry the connection to the RADIUS server
# and not receive a response before giving up. By default the client will try
# the connection at most 5 times.
#
radius-retries: 5

#
# The timeout for a RADIUS connection in seconds. By default the client will
# wait for a response from the server for at most 60 seconds.
#
radius-timeout: 60

#
# When EAP-TTLS is used, this parameter specifies the inner (tunneled) protocol
# to use talking to the RADIUS server. It is required when the
# `radius-auth-protocol` parameter is set to eap-ttls. If the
# `radius-auth-protocol` value is set to something other than eap-ttls, this
# parameter has no effect and will be ignored. Valid options for this are any of
# the values for `radius-auth-protocol`, except for eap-ttls.
#
radius-eap-ttls-inner-protocol: chap

#
# This property allows the server administrator to manually set an IP address
# that will be sent to the RADIUS server to identify this RADIUS client, known
# as the "Network Access Server" (NAS) IP address. When this property is not
# specified, the RADIUS extension attempts to automatically determine the IP
# address of the system on which Guacamole is running and uses that value.
#
radius-nas-ip: 10.11.0.1
