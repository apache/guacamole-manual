# The 128-bit value to use to decrypt and verify the signatures of received
# JSON data. This value must be expressed as a 32-digit hexadecimal value.
#
# Any 32-digit hexadecimal value will suffice as long as it is random enough to
# be impractical for a malicious user to guess. An easy way to generate such a
# key is to echo a secure passphrase through the `md5sum` utility. This is the
# technique OpenSSL itself uses to generate 128-bit keys from passphrases. For
# example:
#
# ```console
# $ echo -n "ThisIsATest" | md5sum
# 4c0b569e4c96df157eee1b65dd0e4d41
# ```
