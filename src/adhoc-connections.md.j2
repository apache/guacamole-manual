Creating ad-hoc connections
===========================

The quickconnect extension provides a connection bar on the Guacamole Client
home page that allows users to type in the URI of a server to which they want
to connect and the client will parse the URI and immediately establish the
connection. The purpose of the extension is to allow situations where
administrators want to allow users the flexibility of establishing their own
connections without having to grant them access to edit connections or even to
have to create the connections at all, aside from typing the URI.

:::{important}
There are several implications of using this extension that should be
well-understood by administrators prior to implementing it:

* Connections established with this extension are created in-memory and only
  persist until the Guacamole session ends.

* Connections created with this extension are not accessible to other users,
  and cannot be shared with other users.

* This extension provides no functionality for authenticating users. It does
  not allow anonymous logins, and it requires that users are successfully
  authenticated by another authentication module before it can be used.

* This extension provides users the ability not only to establish connections,
  but also set any of the parameters for a connection. This has security
  implications. Examples include:

  * RDP file sharing can be used to pass any directory available on the
    server running guacd through to the remote desktop.

  * Guacamole's time-of-first-use certificate feature allows one user
    to accept a certificate on behalf of another user, since Guacamole
    stores certificate fingerprints globally.

  These and other factors should be taken into consideration when enabling
  this extension. You should combine your configuration of the parameters
  allowed by this extension with features of the host system—such
  as filesystem permissions, firewalls, and so on—to achieve your
  security needs.

Installing/Enabling the quickconnect extension
----------------------------------------------

{{ ext.install('QUICKCONNECT', 'guacamole-auth-quickconnect') }}

(guac-quickconnect-config)=

Configuration (optional)
------------------------

{% call ext.config('quickconnect') %}
{{ ext.nothingRequired() }}
Alternatively, you may change the default behavior by defining the
following properties in `guacamole.properties`.
{% endcall %}

Defining a list of included parameters (`quickconnect-allowed-parameters`)
is generally preferable to defining a list of excluded parameters
(`quickconnect-denied-parameters`) if you are trying to meet security
goals. Two reasons for this are that an exclusion list does not consider
parameters Guacamole might support in the future and administrators
sometimes underestimate the impact of a given parameter.

Using the quickconnect extension
--------------------------------

The quickconnect extension provides a field on the home page that allows you to
enter a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to create a connection. A URI is in
the form:

{samp}`{protocol}://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/?{parameters}`

The `protocol` field can have any of the protocols supported by Guacamole, as
documented in [](configuring-guacamole). Many of the protocols define a default
`port` value, with the exception of VNC. The `parameters` field can specify any
of the protocol-specific parameters as documented on the configuration page.

To establish a connection, simply type in a valid URI and either press "Enter"
or click the connect button. This extension will parse the URI and create a new
connection, and immediately start that connection in the current browser.

Here are a few examples of URIs:

`ssh://linux1.example.com/`
: Connect to the server linux1.example.com using the SSH protocol on the
  default SSH port (22). This will result in prompting for both username and
  password.

`vnc://linux1.example.com:5900/`
: Connect to the server linux1.example.com using the VNC protocol and
  specifying the port as 5900.

`rdp://localuser@windows1.example.com/?security=rdp&ignore-cert=true&disable-audio=true&enable-drive=true&drive-path=/mnt/usb`
: Connect to the server windows1.example.com using the RDP protocol and the
  user "localuser". This URI also specifies several RDP-specific parameters on
  the connection, including forcing security mode to RDP (security=rdp), ignoring
  any certificate errors (ignore-cert=true), disabling audio pass-through
  (disable-audio=true), and enabling filesystem redirection (enable-drive=true)
  to the /mnt/usb folder on the system running guacd (drive-path=/mnt/usb).
