    <para>The Java API provided by the Guacamole project is called
        guacamole-common. It provides a basic means of tunneling data between
        the JavaScript client provided by guacamole-common-js and the native
        proxy daemon, guacd. There are other classes provided as well which make
        dealing with the Guacamole protocol and reading from
            <filename>guacamole.properties</filename> easier, but in general,
        the purpose of this library is to facilitate the creation of custom
        tunnels between the JavaScript client and guacd.</para>
    <section>
        <title>HTTP tunnel</title>
        <para>The Guacamole Java API implements the HTTP tunnel using a servlet
            called <classname>GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServlet</classname>. This
            servlet handles all requests coming to it over HTTP from the
            JavaScript client, and translated them into connect, read, or write
            requests, which each get dispatched to the
                <methodname>doConnect()</methodname>,
                <methodname>doRead()</methodname>, and
                <methodname>doWrite()</methodname> functions accordingly.</para>
        <para>Normally, you wouldn't touch the <methodname>doRead()</methodname>
            and <methodname>doWrite()</methodname> functions, as these have
            already been written to properly handle the requests of the
            JavaScript tunnel, and if you feel the need to touch these
            functions, you are probably better off writing your own tunnel
            implementation, although such a thing is difficult to do in a
            performant way.</para>
        <para>When developing an application based on the Guacamole API, you
            should use <classname>GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServlet</classname> by
            extending it, implementing your own version of
                <methodname>doConnect()</methodname>, which is the only abstract
            function it defines. The tutorial later in this book demonstrating
            how to write a Guacamole-based web application shows the basics of
            doing this, but generally, <methodname>doConnect()</methodname> is
            an excellent place for authentication or other validation, as it is
            the responsibility of <methodname>doConnect()</methodname> to create
            (or not create) the actual tunnel. If
                <methodname>doConnect()</methodname> does not create the tunnel,
            communication between the JavaScript client and guacd cannot take
            place, which is an ideal power to have as an authenticator.</para>
        <para>The <methodname>doConnect()</methodname> function is expected to
            "attach" a <classname>GuacamoleTunnel</classname> to the web
            session, abstracted by <classname>GuacamoleSession</classname>.
            Attaching a tunnel to the session allows future tunnel requests to
            retrieve the same tunnel and use it, thus allowing one tunnel to be
            split across multiple requests. Assuming the
                <methodname>doConnect()</methodname> function successfully
            creates the tunnel, it must then return the created tunnel. The
            already-implemented parts of
                <classname>GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServlet</classname> then return
            the unique identifier of this tunnel to the JavaScript client,
            allowing its own tunnel implementation to continue to communicate
            with the tunnel existing on the Java side.</para>
        <para>Intances of <classname>GuacamoleTunnel</classname> are created
            associated with a <classname>GuacamoleSocket</classname>, which is
            the abstract interface surrounding the low-level connection to
            guacd. Overall, there is a socket
                (<classname>GuacamoleSocket</classname>) which provides a TCP
            connection to guacd. This socket is exposed to
                <classname>GuacamoleTunnel</classname>, which provides abstract
            protocol access around what is actually (but secretly, through the
            abstration of the API) a TCP socket. The
                <classname>GuacamoleSession</classname> allows instances of
                <classname>GuacamoleTunnel</classname> to be shared across
            requests, and <classname>GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServlet</classname>
            pulls these tunnels from the session as necessary to fulfull
            requests made by the JavaScript client.</para>
        <para>The Guacamole web application extends this tunnel servlet in order
            to implement authentication at the lowest possible level,
            effectively prohibiting communication between the client and any
            remote desktops unless they have properly authenticated. Your own
            implementation can be considerably simpler, especially if you don't
            need authentication:</para>
        <programlisting>public class MyGuacamoleTunnelServlet
    extends GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServlet {

    @Override
    protected GuacamoleTunnel doConnect(HttpServletRequest request)
        throws GuacamoleException {

        // Connect to guacd here (this is a STUB)
        GuacamoleSocket socket;

        // Establish the tunnel using the connected socket
        GuacamoleTunnel tunnel = new GuacamoleTunnel(socket);

        // Attach tunnel to session
        GuacamoleSession session = new GuacamoleSession(httpSession);
        session.attachTunnel(tunnel);

        // Return pre-attached tunnel
        return tunnel;

    }

}</programlisting>

        <title>Using the Guacamole protocol</title>
        <para>guacamole-common provides basic low-level support for the
            Guacamole protocol. This low-level support is leveraged by the HTTP
            tunnel implementation to satisfy the requirements of the JavaScript
            client implementation, as the JavaScript client expects the
            handshake procedure to have already taken place. This support exists
            through the <classname>GuacamoleReader</classname> and
                <classname>GuacamoleWriter</classname> classes, which are
            similar to Java's <classname>Reader</classname> and
                <classname>Writer</classname> classes, except that they deal
            with the Guacamole protocol specifically, and thus have slightly
            different contracts.</para>
        <section>
            <title><classname>GuacamoleReader</classname></title>
            <para><classname>GuacamoleReader</classname> provides a very basic
                    <methodname>read()</methodname> function which is required
                to return one or more complete instructions in a
                    <type>char</type> array. It also provides the typical
                    <methodname>available()</methodname> function, which informs
                you whether <methodname>read()</methodname> is likely to block
                the next time it is called, and an even more abstract version of
                    <methodname>read()</methodname> called
                    <methodname>readInstruction()</methodname> which returns one
                instruction at a time, wrapped within a
                    <classname>GuacamoleInstruction</classname> instance.</para>
            <para>Normally, you would not need to use this class yourself. It is
                used by <classname>ConfiguredGuacamoleSocket</classname> to
                complete the Guacamole protocol handshake procedure, and it is
                used by <classname>GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServlet</classname> within
                    <methodname>doRead()</methodname> to implement the reading
                half of the tunnel.</para>
            <para>The only concrete implementation of
                    <classname>GuacamoleReader</classname> is
                    <classname>ReaderGuacamoleReader</classname>, which wraps a
                Java <classname>Reader</classname>, using that as the source for
                data to parse into Guacamole instructions. Again, you would not
                normally directly use this class, nor instantiate it yourself. A
                working, concrete instance of
                    <classname>GuacamoleReader</classname> can be retrieved from
                any <classname>GuacamoleSocket</classname> or
                    <classname>GuacamoleTunnel</classname>.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title><classname>GuacamoleWriter</classname></title>
            <para><classname>GuacamoleWriter</classname> provides a very basic
                    <methodname>write()</methodname> function and a more
                abstract version called
                    <methodname>writeInstruction()</methodname> which writes
                instances of <classname>GuacamoleInstruction</classname>. These
                functions are analagous to the <methodname>read()</methodname>
                and <methodname>readInstruction()</methodname> functions
                provided by <classname>GuacamoleReader</classname>, and have
                similar restrictions: the contract imposed by
                    <methodname>write()</methodname> requires that written
                instructions be complete</para>
            <para>The only concrete implementation of
                    <classname>GuacamoleWriter</classname> is
                    <classname>WriterGuacamoleWriter</classname>, which wraps a
                Java <classname>Writer</classname>, using that as the
                destination for Guacamole instruction data, but you would not
                normally directly use this class, nor instantiate it yourself.
                It is used by <classname>ConfiguredGuacamoleSocket</classname>
                to complete the Guacamole protocol handshake procedure, and it
                is used by <classname>GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServlet</classname>
                within <methodname>doWrite()</methodname> to implement the
                writing half of the tunnel.</para>
            <para>If necessary, a <classname>GuacamoleWriter</classname> can be
                retrieved from any <classname>GuacamoleSocket</classname> or
                    <classname>GuacamoleTunnel</classname>, but in most cases,
                the classes provided by the Guacamole Java API which already use
                    <classname>GuacamoleWriter</classname> will be
                sufficient.</para>
